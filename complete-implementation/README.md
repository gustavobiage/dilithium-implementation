## Requirements

### CryptoPP library

* The implementation of Dilithium uses `CryptoPP` library for `SHAKE-126` AND `SHAKE-252` implementation. Therefore, the library is required for the code to be executed.

### Linux *tmp* directory

* In order to compile `pq-crystal/dilithium` implementation, the code is copied to `/tmp` directory. Therefore, the existance of the directory is required for the tests to be executed.
